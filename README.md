##Our Mission

Connecting people with necessities during these virtual times. Use Aid Map to find FREE local WiFi Hotspots and food banks near you!
##Why was Aid Map created?

    With the switch to virtual schooling, many children do not have access to adequate WiFi to attend Zoom lectures. As a result, attendance has dropped dramatically and children are at risk of dropping out of school entirely.

    Aid Map was created as a resource and helper tool for families. It connects families with nearby resources like free WiFi hotspots and food banks to assist them during the virtual schooling era.

##How can you support Aid Map?

    You can support Aid Map by contributing to our data collection. If you notice that a place is offering free WiFi hotspots please input the name and address into our User Submission form. This way we can offer more resources to families in need.

    You can also donate directly to an organization supporting children's education.
